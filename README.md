# <u> <center><b> Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews on WayFair </b></center></u>

## Project Objective
Businesses must be aware of their customers' feedback in order to better serve them. Businesses can learn about insightful trends among their customers and fine-tune their products and services by collecting and analyzing customer reviews. As a result, we intend to select various products from the WayFair.ie websites, conduct some review sentiment analysis on the products, and then make a recommendation based on the analysis results.
