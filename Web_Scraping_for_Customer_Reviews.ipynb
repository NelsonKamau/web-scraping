By collecting and analyzing `customer reviews`, businesses can learn about insightful trends among their customers and fine-tune their products and services. As a result, this project will involve the `scraping of customer reviews` for `DPD Ireland`, one of Ireland's leading `courier service` providers. The `scraped reviews dataset` will then be `cleaned`, and a few `exploratory data analysis` tasks will be performed on the dataset in order to make it suitable for `sentiment analysis` (Sahu et al., 2022)."

The automated bot is useless and just sends you round in circles, getting through to an agent is hit and miss requiring you to repeatedly Submit the same information. If the purpose is for the customer to give up with the query it certainly is working. Then when you do get through you get wrong information- one of my experiences was that I was told the package I was waiting for all day was delivery attempted but failed for some reason and returned to the depot. I spoke to an agent who assured me the package was at the depot and I could collect. I drove 30mins to the local depot to be told that the parcel was still on the van and wasn’t back until later. Then when I asked could I wait as I really needed the item - I was told that the van would not be back to the depot as the driver had been called off on an emergency. I would had understood this if I had been told this from the start but to be all day following up with bots that don’t work, repeatedly having to enter duplicate info to different agents and to get told to collect the package and then it not to be there .
